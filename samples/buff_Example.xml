    You can organize and name tuning files however you wish, including with as
    many subfolders as you want. Notice how the name of this file does not match
    the text in `n`? That's fine too!

    The only restrictions are:
    • Tuning files MUST use the `.xml` file extension
    • SimData files MUST be in the same folder as its paired tuning, and MUST
      have the same name, but with a `.SimData.xml` file extension instead

    S4TK will automatically infer your tuning files' types and instances from
    their `i` and `s` attributes (or use the generic tuning type for modules),
    and will default to a group of 0.

    To see what values S4TK is going to use, check the Type, Group, and Instance
    buttons at the top of this file. If you need to override any of them, click
    the button and a comment that tells S4TK which to use will be inserted.
